TECH4DEV?
The Women Techsters initiative by Tech4Dev is aimed at bridging the digital and technology knowledge divide between men and women as well as ensuring equal access to opportunities for all. We are empowering girls and women across Africa with varying degrees of digital, deep tech, and soft skills required within the technology ecosystem.

The initiative will empower 5 million African women over the next 10 years (2020-2030) through a series of activities held simultaneously across different countries.

Their objective is to grow and support an army of tech-empowered girls and women across Africa who will have equal access to decent job opportunities as well as build and scale their ideas into tech-enabled businesses and deep tech startups, which will aid Africaâ€™s economic growth.
The Fellowship program runs for a 1-year period. The first 6 months are the virtual technical and soft skill training, and the last 6 months are dedicated to experiential learning (Internship) and mentorship.

The learning pathways for this training are:
Blockchain, Cybersecurity, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Engineering, Mixed Reality / 3D Animation, Mobile Applications Development, Product Design (UI/UX), Product Management and Software Development.

The learning track I chose was DATA SCIENCE AND AI.
This Repo consists of all the projects I will be working on as I undergo my training with tech4dev
